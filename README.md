### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me introduce myself.
I am Chris from Washington State, USA.

As a senior full stack and blockchain engineer with over 6 years of experience, I am so confident with Javascript/Typescript and Python languages.
And for recent 3 years I've been concentrating on DApp development.
I am familiar with agile methodologies(Jira/Trello/Azure/etc) and version control systems(gitHub, gitLab, bitBucket).
Strong in solving problems and providing clean and scalable codebase.

Thank you.
